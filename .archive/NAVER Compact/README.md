# NAVER Compact
[Install](https://github.com/TetraTheta/TetraUserScripts/raw/main/.archive/NAVER%20Compact/NAVER-Compact.user.js)

I think NAVER's website is bloated. So this script will remove various 'useless' items from NAVER's main page and search results.
Please note that this script won't reduce the amount of traffic you use. This script will just 'hide'(or 'remove') things from your browser screen.
