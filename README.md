These are some UserScripts made by me. Click the name of the script to install.

## [OBSOLETE] [`DCinside_NoIMG_Recovery.user.js`](https://github.com/TetraTheta/TetraUserJS/raw/master/scripts/DCinside_NoIMG_Recovery.user.js)

Recently, DCinside got a DDOS attack, so many images don't load properly. This script will replace the 'No Image' error with the original image, which is always available.

## [`Force_Font_Apply.user.js](https://github.com/TetraTheta/TetraUserJS/raw/master/scripts/Force_Font_Apply.user.js)

This script will force-apply CSS to certain websites.

## [`GitHub_WordWrap.user.js`](https://github.com/TetraTheta/TetraUserJS/raw/master/scripts/GitHub_WordWrap.user.js)

GitHub doesn't provide word-wrap for their source code view. This script will add that to the code view screen.

## [OBSOLETE] [`NAVER_Compact.user.js`](https://github.com/TetraTheta/TetraUserJS/raw/master/scripts/NAVER_Compact.user.js)

I think NAVER's website is bloated. So this script will remove various 'useless' items from NAVER's main page and search results.
Please note that this script won't reduce the amount of traffic you use. This script will just 'hide'(or 'remove') things from your browser screen.
